#268
* New stylesheet
* Icons
* Ability to edit themes
* Themes have description free text fields as well
* Ferret has been implemented across user stories and so the search box does not only search on tags
* The backlog view has been cleaned up
* Bug on taskboard chart fixed (was caused when sprint spanned more than one month)
* You may experiment logging in via subdomain (not 100% there yet but worth testing)
* Started a separate user story show page
* Tag cloud no longer has impossibly small font sizes
* User stories lacking estimation are more obvious (need to rename them from Undefined as they are technically defined) 
* Minor clean up of sprint planning pages
